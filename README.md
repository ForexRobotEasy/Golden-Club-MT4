## Functionality
The Golden Club MT4 trading robot implements a trading strategy based on market conditions. It uses smart entry calculations to execute trades and adjusts its trading strategy based on market conditions. The robot also monitors trade performance to optimize trading results.

The code is structured as follows:

### Import necessary libraries
The code imports the necessary libraries for trading and position information.

### Define constants
The code defines constants such as the strategy count, initial price, and price increase rate.

### Define global variables
The code defines global variables including the strategy index and current price.

### Define trading robot class
The code defines a trading robot class, `CGoldenClubMT4`, which encapsulates the trading logic.

#### Constructor and Destructor
The constructor initializes the trading robot by calling the `OnInit()` function, while the destructor cleans up the trading robot by calling the `OnDeinit()` function.

#### Initialization function
The `OnInit()` function sets the stop loss protection for all trades, subscribes to market data, and starts trading by calling the `OnTick()` function.

#### Cleanup function
The `OnDeinit()` function stops trading by closing all trades.

#### Main trading function
The `OnTick()` function is the main trading function that executes the trading logic. It checks if market conditions are favorable, executes trades based on smart entry calculations, adjusts the trading strategy, and monitors trade performance.

#### Market condition check function
The `IsMarketConditionFavorable()` function checks if market conditions are favorable. This function should be implemented with specific logic to check market conditions and return `true` if conditions are favorable, or `false` otherwise.

#### Trade execution function
The `ExecuteTrade()` function executes trades based on smart entry calculations. This function should be implemented with specific logic to execute trades.

#### Trading strategy adjustment function
The `AdjustTradingStrategy()` function adjusts the trading strategy based on market conditions. This function should be implemented with specific logic to adjust the trading strategy.

#### Trade performance monitoring function
The `MonitorTradePerformance()` function monitors trade performance. This function should be implemented with specific logic to monitor trade performance.

### Entry point of the program
The `OnInit()` function is the entry point of the program. It creates an instance of the `CGoldenClubMT4` trading robot and returns the initialization result.

### Event handlers and utility functions
Additional event handlers and utility functions can be added to the code as needed.

### Increase the price of the robot every week
The `IncreasePrice()` function increases the price of the robot every week by adding the price increase rate to the current price.

### Main program loop
The `StartProgram()` function is the main program loop. It checks if a week has passed, increases the price of the robot, executes other program logic, and sleeps for a week.

### Check if a week has passed
The `IsWeekPassed()` function checks if a week has passed. This function should be implemented with specific logic to check if a week has passed and return `true` if a week has passed, or `false` otherwise.

### Program entry point
The `start()` function is the program entry point. It starts the main program loop and returns 0 to indicate successful execution.
